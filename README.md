<h1>Steganography Practice</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I will show how data can be extracted from images. I will conceal a secret message in an image file and extract it into files using Steghide.<br/>

<h2>Tools Used</h2>

- <b>VMware</b> 
- <b>Kali Linux</b>
- <b>Steghide</b>


<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

- First we need to install Steghide in our Kali Linux.
- Open a terminal in Kali and run this command: <b>sudo apt install steghide</b>
- Next you will need to choose an image where you will conceal a message. You can download it using a browser that you have in your Kali Linux or by dragging your image from your host machine to Kali desktop.
